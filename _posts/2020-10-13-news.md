Over 300 diploid potato varieties were evaluated in a small-plot yield trial at the University of Wisconsin Hancock Agricultural Research Station (HARS).

These diploids are 1â€“2 generations descended from dihaploids created through haploid induction of elite tetraploids from UW-Madison. The trial was mechanically harvested and graded in early October 2020. There was tremendous variation for yield, tuber size and appearance, with a number of diploids performing comparable to tetraploid checks. Specific gravity and chip fry quality will be measured in December.
