In June and July, we have been extracting dihaploids from field-grown plants.

Flowering stems were cut, placed in buckets with water, and brought back to air-conditioned greenhouses in Madison.

We then put stems in glass milk bottles filled with water

 then pollinated them with the dihaploid extraction parent IVP 101.

Then, we wait for berries to develop.
