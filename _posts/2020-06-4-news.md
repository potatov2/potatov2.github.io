Diploid seedling families have been transplanted to the field at the Hancock, Wisconsin, Agricultural Research Station.  

Tuber families will be harvested and used in a 2021 field trial along with seedlings from the same families. The goal will be to compare plant development in genetically similar material that starts from seed tubers versus transplants.
