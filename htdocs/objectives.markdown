**Table 1.** Research objectives.

| 1. Self-compatibility | Determine the genetic basis and environmental stability of self-fertility.|
| 2. Self-compatible (SC) diploids | Develop self-fertile, diploid germplasm that captures the allelic diversity of tetraploid cultivars.|
| 3. Inbreds | Create inbred lines that are fixed (homozygous) for key traits. |
| 4. True potato seed (TPS) | Develop agronomic and economic frameworks for incorporating TPS into the potato production system and assessing its impacts |
